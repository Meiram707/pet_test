# pet_test
my first project on pure js,
I'm ashamed of such boring and low-quality projects,
but I understand that many people start with this


The idea is to add elements to the page,
the parameters and styles of which can be set in the form,
a kind of constructor is obtained,
I wrote this code while watching a video on YouTube
